UPDATE sixty60_data_final
SET Item_Fat_Content =
  CASE
    WHEN Item_Fat_Content IN ('LF', 'low fat') THEN 'Low Fat'
    WHEN Item_Fat_Content = 'reg' THEN 'Regular'
    ELSE Item_Fat_Content
  END;
```

### üîπ KPI Calculations
```sql
SELECT CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) / 1000000.0 AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales_Million FROM sixty60_data_final;
SELECT CAST(AVG(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,1)) AS Avg_Sales FROM sixty60_data_final;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS No_of_Orders FROM sixty60_data_final;
SELECT CAST(AVG(Rating) AS DECIMAL(10,0)) AS Avg_Rating FROM sixty60_data_final;
```

### üîπ Fat Content by Outlet Location
```sql
SELECT Outlet_Location_Type,
  CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Item_Fat_Content = 'Low Fat' THEN Total_Sales ELSE 0 END) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Low_Fat,
  CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Item_Fat_Content = 'Regular' THEN Total_Sales ELSE 0 END) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Regular
FROM sixty60_data_final
GROUP BY Outlet_Location_Type
ORDER BY Outlet_Location_Type;
```

### üîπ Sales by Outlet Size
```sql
SELECT Outlet_Size,
  CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales,
  CAST((SUM(Total_Sales) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(Total_Sales)) OVER()) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Sales_Percentage
FROM sixty60_data_final
GROUP BY Outlet_Size
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;
